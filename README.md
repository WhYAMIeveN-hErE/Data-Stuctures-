LAB 1
1. Write a C++ menu-driven program to sort a given array in ascending order. Design proper functions, maintain boundary conditions, and follow coding best practices. The menus are as follows,

a.       Bubble Sort

b.      Selection Sort

c.       Insertion Sort

d.      Exit

 

2. Convert the sorting program into a header file and include it into a new cpp file. Write a C++ menu-driven program for linear and binary search in this new cpp file. Utilize any of the sorting functions in the included header file to sort the input array before performing a binary search. Design proper functions, maintain boundary conditions and follow coding best practices. The menu-driven program supports,

a.       Linear Search

b.      Binary Search

c.       Exit



LAB 2
1. Write a C++ menu-driven program to determine whether a number is a  Palindrome, Armstrong, or Perfect Number. Normal variable and array declarations are not allowed. Utilize dynamic memory allocation (DMA). Design proper functions, maintain boundary conditions, and follow coding best practices. The menu is as follows,

a.       Palindrome

b.      Armstrong Number

c.       Perfect Number

d.      Exit

 

2. Write a C++ menu-driven program that calculates and displays the area of a square, cube, rectangle, and cuboid. Consider length as the side value for the square and cuboid. Identify proper data members and member functions. Design and create an appropriate class for the given scenario.  Maintain proper boundary conditions and follow coding best practices. The menus are as follows,
 a) Square
 b) Cube
 c) Rectangle

 d) Cuboid
 e) Exit
